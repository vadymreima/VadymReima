    <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early 
            schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War.

    <h3>Court case and the denial of degree</h3>
        <p>
            Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. 
            His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external <br> examiners and thus he was 
            not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation 
            of his civil rights and that the <br> university had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. 
            The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of <br> Appeals [8]
